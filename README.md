# CLIB
This is a header-only library containing all sorts of functions, data structures, and macros that
I find myself using on a somewhat regular basis.

To use this library, create one and only one `.c` file with the following content:
```c
#define CLIB_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "/path/to/clib.h"
```
